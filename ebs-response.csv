,,Deficit Weight Dispute,No Class/NMFC on BOL and Billed per Description,Billed using NDEN/NDES,,,,,,;;

Thank you for reaching out with your invoicing question. The system automatically adds a deficit weight to the actual weight of a shipment to reduce the freight cost for the customer. This happens if the actual weight of a shipment is near a major weight break (i.e., 500, 1000, 5000 lbs., etc.…).;;
;;
By adding a deficit weight, the rate per one hundred pounds (i.e., CWT) is lowered, providing savings for the customer. Simply put, the more weight, the better the rate (CWT).;;

Upon review of your case, the reweigh certificate is not on file. The reweigh performed decreased the weight of your shipment which also decreased the amount due for this shipment. I can correct this shipment so the weight matches the bill of lading, but this will increase the amount due as well.;;

During my research of this case, an error was found with the reweigh so the weight was updated to match the weight on the bill of lading. If you feel that the BOL Weight is not accurate, please provide the following documentation:;;
• packing list or sales invoice with reference numbers will work but will need to include the ship date, shipper, consignee, weight, and the quantity of item(s) shipped ;;

The reweigh certificate is the legal binding document confirming the weight increase or decrease for all FedEx Freight shipments. Supporting documents for the commodities shipped that verifies the correct weight is needed for further review. Please provide a sales invoice, packing slip that lists ship date, shipper, consignee, the item count of the commodities shipped, a catalog page or advertising literature that can be matched up with the item count that provides the correct weight. Link to website that includes weight is also suggested for review. If required documentation cannot be provided, we are unable to further review this dispute. This case will remain open 5 business days pending documentation.;;

I am happy to inform you that your reweigh dispute has been reviewed and approved. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. I have updated the weight based on the documents provided.;;
;;
Please note that a reweigh convenience fee of $36.00 will still apply if the shipment exceeds 50 pounds or is more than 200 pounds under the weight listed on the Bill of Lading (BOL), in line with FXF 100-W Rules Tariff Item 981, effective At time of shipment. An excerpt from the Rules Tariff is included below for your reference.;;

An updated invoice using your preferred delivery method on file will be sent for any balance due after these adjustments are made;;

Unfortunately, the supporting documentation is not a valid proof of weight. For my research of your reweigh dispute, I will need two pieces of documentation with specific information.;;
;;
The first piece of documentation is either a packing slip or sales invoice. This piece of documentation will need to include reference numbers, ship date, shipper, consignee, weight and the quantity of item(s) shipped. ;;
;;
The second supporting document needed, a catalog page or webpage link, will be used to establish the weight of the item and will be used to match back up to the item shipped from the packing list/sales invoice.;;
;;
These supporting documents cannot be in the form of handwritten documentation, spreadsheets, photos on a scale, or certified scale certificates.;;

Once I receive both pieces of valid documentation with the information noted above, I can continue my review, reconcile the weight for the shipment, and make any applicable updates.;;

FedEx’s Reweigh Verification Process was performed at a FedEx Freight Service Center and determined the weight from shipment didn’t match the bill of lading.  When the weight doesn’t match, the weight for the shipment is automatically updated.  My goal is to confirm the correct weight for this shipment but I will need two additional pieces of documentation from you for the commodities shipped to do that. ;;

Please provide the following documentation within five (5) days:;;
